# Computer_Sales_WebApp
This is my first ASP.NET Web Application Where i made a simple website and connected that to my database ,where I display the Computer items for sale
and give them an option to filter their search records by writing a few SQL queries.One more feature of this Apllication was its CRUD APP functionality where ASP.NET was very handy
i could easily ,create,update and Delete records from my my Database.
