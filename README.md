# Computer_Sales_WebApp
This is my first ASP.NET Web Application Where i made a simple website and connected that to my database ,where I display the Computer items for sale
and give them an option to filter their search records which was done by writing pre-made  SQL queries.One more feature of this Application was its CRUD APP functionality where ASP.NET was very handy as it uses MVC framework from which I could easily ,create,update and Delete records from my  Database.
